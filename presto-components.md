## Presto Components

The whole app is split into 3 sections:

* [Handling UI Actions](/presto-components/ui.md)
* [How to make API calls](/presto-components/api.md)
* [Managing Local Storage](/presto-components/api/managing-local-storage.md)

Once you have cloned the GitHub repository, you can follow along and understand how the app is built.
