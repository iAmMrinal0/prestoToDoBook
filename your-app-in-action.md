## Your App in Action

Time to run the app and see how the whole thing runs.

Run the following command in the Terminal to compile the PureScript code and save the result to `index.js`:

```bash
$ npm run watch:purs
```

Run the server using:

```
$ npm start
```

Now open the `index.html` file in your browser to view it.
